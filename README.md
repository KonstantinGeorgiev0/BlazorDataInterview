Itility Technical Interview Assignment

Task
In our "Smart applicator" project we take pictures of pizzas on a production line to determine the amount of cheese.

For this, we have a set-up of a camera and an IPC (industrial PC) next to the production line.
The project was so successful that it was quickly rolled out to several major pizza factories in Europe.

During the first period, we bought large IPC’s to make sure everything worked (based on an estimation of how many resources each set-up would require since there is also other business-critical software on each IPC which our program should not interrupt).

The file in the attachment shows the measurement data of the IPC's over 2 months, such as max CPU usage, average per measurement moment, and capacity. 
We want to use these measurements to define if there are IPC's that do not use their full capacity.

Assignment:
    * Use Blazor to show which IPC’s can be downsized and show a couple of visuals in a PowerPoint presentation.
