# Blazor Data Project

## Smart applicator 
#### Set-up: camera and an IPC (industrial PC) next to the production line.
#### Initially bought large IPCâ€™s to make sure everything worked. 
#### Given: measurement data of the IPC's over 2 months, such as max CPU usage, average per measurement moment, and capacity. 
#### ToDo: use these measurements to define if there are IPC's that do not use their full capacity.

## Getting started
Run the command `dotnet build` to install all required packages.

To start the web page, run `dotnet watch` to start the webpack dev server. This server is reachable at `localhost:5157`
and autoreloads any changes you make in the code.
